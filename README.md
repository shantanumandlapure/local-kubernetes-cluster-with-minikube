# 🚀 Local Kubernetes Cluster with MiniKube

A hands-on DevOps project that sets up a **local Kubernetes cluster** using **MiniKube** and **Docker**, mirroring a real-world cloud environment. This setup integrates **CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions** for automated deployment and provides a **cost-effective, practical platform** to learn and demonstrate modern DevOps practices.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This project is ideal for developers and DevOps engineers looking to:

- ✅ Understand how **Kubernetes** works in a real-world setup
- ✅ Practice **containerization with Docker**
- ✅ Implement and test **CI/CD pipelines locally**
- ✅ Simulate a **production-like environment** without cloud costs

By running everything locally, you gain complete control and visibility into each component of the DevOps lifecycle.

   cd Local-Kubernetes-Cluster-with-MiniKube
Set up Python environment

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
Build the Docker image

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t yourimage:latest .
Start the MiniKube cluster

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube start

kubectl apply -f newapp-service.yaml
Access the deployed application

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube service newapp-service
🧠 Conceptual Highlights
MiniKube simulates a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine — perfect for experimentation and testing.

Docker packages your Django application and its dependencies into containers.

Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) define how your application is deployed and exposed.

GitHub Actions enables CI/CD: automatically building, testing, and deploying your app on every commit.

This project serves as a self-contained DevOps sandbox for experimenting with cloud-native principles — without the cloud bill.

🤖 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This project uses GitHub Actions to implement a basic CI/CD pipeline:

Trigger: On every push or pull request

Steps:

Set up Python

Install dependencies

Run tests (optional)

Build Docker image

Push image (optional)

Apply Kubernetes manifests (if connected to a real cluster)

🛠️ You can extend this workflow to include Helm, Secrets management, or even deployment to a cloud provider like GKE or EKS.

🧪 Ideal Use Cases
Practicing real-world DevOps workflows locally

Demoing CI/CD pipelines without needing a cloud subscription

Building foundational understanding of Kubernetes and container orchestration

Learning GitHub Actions by customizing your workflow
